Men’s Personal Grooming includes information on Changes and Checkups, Bathroom Conduct, Male Grooming Habits, Grooming Hair, Shaving & Saving Face, Male Body Grooming Techniques, Men's Skin Care, Nail care, and Male Grooming Supplies & Products. This class will let you discover how to get hair that gets you noticed, how to pass the squint test and make your face not crack, and how to flash: take a fingernail test and pass. \r\nEssential Etiquette is about cool thins to know: traditions governing business and social behavior, consideration, and taste: things of which young professionals and unpcoming graduates  need to be mindful.\r\nLook your best. Manners are (what Mama likes) things you \"know” to do. Etiquette is the set of rules that go with manners. Manners must be married to etiquette for there to be a good fit; what you approve of must be married with the set of rules for the court you are in or for the court at the level to which you wish to ascend. He who has the talent and follows the rules best wins. \r\n“Do not hate the player or the game.

        "name": "Bronze Age Sword Casting Class",
        "description": "Have you ever watched someone making a sword in the movies and thought it looked too cool for school? If so, this class is for you! Join us in downtown Austin for a 4-5  hour class (9-2 pm), where you'll learn some of the history of metallurgy, then choose a wooden sword from one of several historical Bronze Age patterns. Next you’ll get your hands dirty making a sand cast of the wooden original, and then watch as we pour an exact copy of it in molten aluminum! Then, while you have lunch, my assistants & I grind the swords smooth and prepare them for handles. When you come back, wrap the handle in leather and take the metal sword home! $95 This class is an Austin original, usually sells out, and is not taught anywhere else, so grab a friend and strike while the iron is hot! Want to see more? Last spring we were featured in BESTAUSTIN, https://youtu.be/vtPHmAC1r6I It is a good summary of the class & shows some of my other maker projects. And recently I helped Andy from How To Make Everything with his goal of casting 2 swords: one  from bronze he made himself, and the other from an alloy made from melted pennies. The penny episode has already had over 2.4M views--check it out! https://youtu.be/CutjZmHoJ3IOr see Sword Casting Guy’s FB page to see pictures and read raves from happy customers. The class grew out of a desire to make Ancient Civilizations class more hands on, and so is taught very interactively, with lots of archaeology, history, and physics connections being explored. \nNote: This class takes place at the Headwaters School campus, between 807 & 809 Rio Grande near the picnic tables.\n\nFAQs\n\nIs there a minimum age requirement to take the class?\nKids as young as 7 can take the class as long as they have an adult to help them. And you wouldn't be alone--it is common to have almost as many adults as kids come to experience this amazing process!\n\nHow many tickets do I need?\nThe cost of the class is per sword cast, not per participant, so it depends if mom or dad want to cast their own sword. They often do!\n\nI like to do woodworking--can I make a sword ahead of time and bring it to class to cast?\nYes, some of the coolest swords we've seen have come along this way. If you want to try this, email me for dimensions and a few sword design rules of thumb.\n\nCan adults come without a kid?\nSure! People of truly all ages come to my classes--it really feels like a community event.\n\nSounds dangerous. Is it safe?\nAs a veteran science teacher, safety is my first priority. Participants are always a safe distance from any burn hazard, swords are not sharpened to a cutting edge, and no sword fighting is allowed in class. In casting over 2,000 swords with multi-age classes, there has never been an injury bigger than a scratch.\n",

        "name": "2.5hr Beginner's Photography Class (Austin, TX)",
        "description": "Become a better photographer and stop using your camera's \"Auto\" mode in 1 day.\r\nHave you ever wondered why after spending hundreds of dollars on the latest cameras you still can't get photos you're really proud of? We're not talking about the party snapshots you post on Facebook, but stunning landscapes that can be considered fine art and grab attention for longer than 5 seconds.\r\nLearn to capture beautiful photos and never miss a memory again.\r\nThis 2.5 hour class is a crash course in digital photography. Taught in our Austin studio (in groups of around 20 students), you'll learn what all those knobs and dials on your DSLR do, the settings to use in any lighting condition, and even what kind of camera to buy if you don't already have one. You'll understand concepts like exposure, aperture, depth of field and shutter speed, and probably never want to use the \"automatic mode\" again.\r\nNo prior experience or camera equipment is necessary to attend. Just a desire to improve your photography skills. Take this class for yourself or gift it to a friend who's got a photographic itch to scratch. \r\nFrequently Asked Questions\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat's the class schedule? This is a 2.5 hour class held most Saturdays and Sundays from 10am-12:30pm. The dates are scheduled approximately 1 month in advance, and more dates are added every few weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat's the format of this class? It's a group class held in an indoor classroom setting in groups of around 20 students.\r\n\r\n\r\nI already have some photography experience.  Will this class be useful for me? Yes, it could be a good refresher for you to consolidate all the bits and pieces of knowledge you've picked up over the years. You'll also find plenty of inspiration (in the form of some beautiful photos) to get back into photography if you haven't done it in a while. You get to ask any burning questions to a professional photographer. And it's a great way to spend an afternoon in the company of other beginners and amateurs. However, if you already have a good handle on things like shutter speed, aperture, ISO and manual mode, then Photo Walk and Adobe Lightroom Class are a better fit for you.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat kind of camera do I need to attend this class? Bring whichever camera you currently own. No need to buy anything special or fancy for this class. We explain the differences between simple point & shoot cameras and DSLRs, so you'll be better informed about what kind of camera to buy, should you decide to upgrade your current one.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat else should I bring to class? Anything you need to take notes on (pen, paper, iPad, laptop etc) and a snack or drink.\r\n\r\n\r\nHave more questions? Please shoot us an email for a quick response (faster than calling, leaving a voicemail and waiting to hear back).",

        "description": "Need a break from the snarky, sharky, and stiff pitch forums?  Come join the Kauffman Foundation's 1 Million Cups for a cup of coffee and a community-centered approach to helping start-ups answer that 1 question that is stumping your business. Presentations start at 9am sharp so come a few minutes early to grab a cup of coffee and settle in. \r\nHow 1MC works:\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday mornings, one or two early-stage businesses present their companies to a diverse local audience of peers, mentors, educators, and advisors.\r\n\r\n\r\nEach founder’s presentation lasts six minutes and is followed by a 20-minute question-and-answer session with the audience.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the question-and-answer session, the presenter is always asked this question: “What can we, as a community, do to help you?”\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nDecember's Presenters:\r\nSpark\r\nSparks is a EV map mobile app. We will help ev drivers find a reliable charging station within a 3 mile radius of their current location.\r\nSipNShut\r\nSipNShut has developed a new reclosable beverage can that is made from 100% aluminum. It is recyclable and gives brands an alternative to plastic bottles and existing reclosable cans that mix plastic and metal\r\n \r\nParking Options:\r\nStreet Parking and Garage at 5th and Colorado.\r\nPro-tip: Park on outskirts and bike or scooter over.\r\n \r\n\r\n1 MILLION CUPS is a free, nationwide program designed to educate, engage and accelerate early-stage startups. We believe in the notion that entrepreneurs can discover solutions and thrive when they collaborate over a million cups of coffee. Drop in on our community of innovators and entrepreneurship enthusiasts to connect and support our local startups.\r\nThe 1MC name was inspired by an article titled “A Million Cups,” written by Seth Kravitz, founder of Technori. The premise of the article is that true communities are built through meaningful interactions between people over a million cups of coffee.\r\n1MC’s culture is supportive and neutral, welcoming entrepreneurs to be open and honest about their businesses and the challenges they face. The program's platform is not a traditional “pitch” environment. Rather, an entrepreneur makes an educational presentation to a room of individuals who can provide constructive criticism, share experiences and support one another as a community.\r\nTo learn more or apply, click here. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

You may invited them for just in time for dinner ... or perhaps earlier to help with the preparations (like teach them how to stuff a turkey) ... or something that is often a great blessing ... invite them to spend the night.    When your Thanksgiving is over  (4P, 8P, 1A or whenever!) you to take them back to their apartment. \r\nIdeally you will connect with your international guests and become their \"friendship partners\" in an on-going basis.  Building this relationship is also the foundation on which you will earn the right to share the gospel.  ",
