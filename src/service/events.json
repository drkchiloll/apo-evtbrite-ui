Or does it???Come support some of Fallout Theater and the Austin Improv Communty's best performers on a Sunday night in downtown Austin, TX.\nBYOB / $5 online / $7 at the door\nFAQSARE THERE ID REQUIREMENTS OR AN AGE LIMIT TO ENTER YOUR EVENTS? Unless specifically stated above, Fallout Theater is all ages and BYOB. However, if the event is providing free booze (which sometimes happens), or if we have drink service provided by Party Pulse, you'll have to show a 21+ ID in order to partake. Other than that, our programming tends to be PG-13 & up, so keep that in mind.WHAT’S YOUR REFUND POLICY? If you buy an online ticket, you should arrive 30 min before the start of the show to guarantee getting a seat because we also sell tickets at the door and usually have a crowd waiting for no-show seats. If you don't arrive at least 10 min before the show, your seats could be given out to people on our waiting list, and if that happens, you will not be entitled to a refund as we don't offer refunds after the show has started.---------------------------------------------------This show is presented by talent from Fallout Theater, the newest destination for Austin Comedy and the premiere destination for Alternative Improv/Sketch/Stand- Up. Come early to chill in our downtown lobby lounge and meet the best comedians around. Register for our sketch & improv classes year-round at FalloutComedy.com.\n",

This will be a Camo themed party Nov. 10th, at Voodoo Room 3rd floor from 10pm-2am.  Some of Austin's best local DJ's will be spinning lots of groovy tech house and Nu Disco tunes.  10% percent of bar sales will be donated to Make a Vet Sweat, a non-profit that sponsors gym memberships for veterans to help  combat anxiety and PTSD.  Full Scope Entertainment will match the donation, along with other local Austin companies (if you know someone who might be interested in matching donations DM Steven Scott Slyter).We will have camo themed dancers, decorations, additional lighting and visual effects, and a live sax player.  This will be filmed with a recap video played to an original track produced by one of the artist.
